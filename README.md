# X-Clone
A twitter clone for Android running on Java front end and back end made in a class.
The backend is hosted on AWS s3, DynamoDb, and Lambda instances so that the application is scalable to a large number of users.
Had to pass a test where it scaled to 10000 users following one person all being updated within 20 seconds of a post being made.

wrote some unit tests, uml diagrams, and the mvp pattern for the android front end ui using observers and presenters, as well as Lambda functions to handle the backend calls.
